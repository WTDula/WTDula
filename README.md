I am a Front-End Engineer with experience with HTML/CSS/Javascript
I enjoy making other websites look nice and function as best as they can while I kind of struggle to find inspiration for my own website.
I've been practicing with React and using APIs.  I have completed a few projects with React and APIs (recreating themovieDB and edamam's search sites) but can't find a secure way of uploading them while they are still working.  It seems when I put the API keys in the .env folder and use process.env, the app doesn't recognize the path it goes to.  So I've been switching between fetch and axios to see which one I like better.  So far, axios seems to be giving me much less trouble (not to mention there's not as many ) and } to keep track of.
So I will continue to work with APIs and maybe move into learning Redux.
